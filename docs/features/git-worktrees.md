# Git Worktrees

Lerd automatically detects [git worktrees](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree) and gives each checkout its own subdomain, no configuration needed.

```bash
cd ~/Lerd/myapp

# Add a worktree for a feature branch
git worktree add ../myapp-feature feature/auth

# Lerd immediately creates:
#   http://feature-auth.myapp.test  →  ~/Lerd/myapp-feature/public
```

Branch names are sanitised to be subdomain-safe: `/`, `_`, and `.` are replaced with `-`, and non-alphanumeric characters are stripped.

---

## How it works

When the Lerd watcher daemon is running it watches each registered site's `.git/` directory. As soon as `git worktree add` writes its metadata under `.git/worktrees/`, Lerd:

1. Reads the branch name and checkout path from the worktree metadata.
2. Generates an nginx vhost for `<branch>.<site>.test` pointing at the worktree's `public/` directory.
3. Reloads nginx so the subdomain starts serving immediately.

When `git worktree remove` is run the vhost is removed and nginx is reloaded.

Renaming the branch inside a worktree (`git branch -m`, `git checkout -b`) is also picked up: Lerd watches each worktree's `HEAD` and re-syncs the vhost and `.env` to the new branch name without a manual restart.

Existing worktrees are also picked up on watcher startup, so nothing is lost after a reboot.

## Dependency setup

When a worktree vhost is first created, Lerd sets up three things in the checkout directory automatically:

| Resource | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `vendor/` | Copied from the main repo using reflinks where the filesystem supports them (btrfs, xfs-reflink, APFS), then reconciled against the worktree's own `composer.lock` via `composer install` |
| `node_modules/` | Copied from the main repo (reflink where supported), then reconciled against the worktree's own lockfile via the matching package manager (pnpm / yarn / bun / npm, auto-detected from `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `yarn.lock`, `bun.lock*`, or `package-lock.json`) |
| `.env` | Copied from the main repo with `APP_URL` rewritten to `http://<branch>.<site>.test`. On every subsequent worktree scan `APP_URL` is realigned with the current vhost domain, so a `git branch -m` or a manual rename keeps the `.env` in sync. The write is skipped when the value is already correct, so dev-side watchers don't see spurious mtime bumps. |

If `vendor/` or `node_modules/` already exist as real directories they are left untouched. Legacy symlinks left by earlier lerd versions are replaced with real copies.

On reflink-capable filesystems the initial copy is near-instant and consumes no extra disk until a file is modified. On ext4 it falls back to a plain copy, which typically takes a few seconds per vendor tree. The subsequent `composer install` plus the JS install is a quick verification pass when the worktree branch shares the same lockfile as main, and installs only the differences when the branch has changed dependencies. If the detected package manager isn't on `PATH` (e.g. `pnpm-lock.yaml` but no pnpm installed) the JS step is skipped with a warning so the rest of the worktree is still usable.

::: info Why not symlink?
Earlier versions of lerd symlinked `vendor/` to save disk. PHP resolves `__DIR__` through symlinks to the real filesystem path, so Composer's `ClassLoader` would initialise against the main repo directory and silently load stale classes from there. Real copies avoid the problem while still being cheap on modern filesystems.

## HTTPS

If the parent site is secured with `lerd secure`, worktree subdomains inherit HTTPS automatically. Lerd reuses the parent site's wildcard mkcert certificate (`*.myapp.test`), so no additional certificate is needed.

```bash
lerd secure myapp
# myapp.test         → https
# feature-auth.myapp.test → https  (automatic)
```

`APP_URL` in each worktree's `.env` is also updated to `https://` when you secure or unsecure the parent.

---

## `lerd sites` output

Worktrees are shown indented under their parent site:

```
NAME            DOMAIN                   PHP    NODE   TLS   PATH
myapp           myapp.test               8.5    22     ✓     ~/Lerd/myapp
↳ feature-auth  feature-auth.myapp.test  8.5    -      -     ~/Lerd/myapp-feature
```

---

## Web UI

In the Sites tab, any site that has active worktrees shows a branch icon in the sidebar. Clicking the site opens its detail panel which lists the worktrees as a tree. The **main checkout's current branch** is shown at the top of the tree with a link to the main site's domain, followed by each worktree branch below it.
